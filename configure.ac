AC_OUTPUT

# Avoid the perceived need to run automake again when building from source
# tarballs. The assorted AM include macros assume two passes are needed to
# generate a makefile since one pass has to generate the includes and the
# second one inlines them, but we're distributing a ready-to-use version and
# hence one pass is enough. We can skip ahead and assume the Makefile template
# is ready to go an this point, avoiding the need for autotools at all.
